# Anthony Fu's Skills

A curated collection of [agent skills](https://agentskills.io/home) reflecting [Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu)'s preferences, experience, and best practices for modern web development.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a proof-of-concept project for generating agent skills from source documentation and keeping them in sync.
> I haven't fully tested how well the skills perform in practice, so feedback and contributions are welcome.

## Installation

## What Makes This Collection Different?

This collection is opinionated, but the key difference is that it uses git submodules to directly reference source documentation. This provides more reliable context and allows the skills to stay up-to-date with upstream changes over time. If you primarily work with Vue/Vite/Nuxt, this aims to be a comprehensive one-stop collection.

The project is also designed to be flexible - you can use it as a template to generate your own skills collection.

## Generate Your Own Skills

Fork this project to create your own customized skill collection.

1. Fork or clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Update `meta.ts` with your own projects and skill sources
4. Run `nr start cleanup` to remove existing submodules and skills
5. Run `nr start init` to clone the submodules
6. Run `nr start sync` to sync vendored skills
7. Ask your agent to "generate skills for \<project\>" (recommended one at a time to manage token usage)
